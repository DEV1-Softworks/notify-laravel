Adapter package to integrate [DEV1 Notify Core](https://packagist.org/packages/dev1/notify-core) into **Laravel 8+**.

Provides:
- Service Provider for Notify Core
- Config publishing (`config/notify.php`)
- Custom Laravel Notification Channel (`dev1-notify`)
- Logger bridge to Laravel.

---

## Installation

```bash
composer require dev1/notify-laravel
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=notify-config
```

## Configuration

---

.env example:
```env
NOTIFY_DEFAULT=fcm
NOTIFY_FCM_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
NOTIFY_FCM_SA_PATH=app/firebase/service-account.json
NOTIFY_LOG=true (optional, default true)
```

For FCM v1, you need to create a Firebase project and generate a service account key JSON file at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). After you download the JSON file, place it in a secure location within your Laravel project (e.g., `storage/app/firebase/service-account.json`).

Config file (`config/notify.php`) example:
```php
return [
    'default' => env('NOTIFY_DEFAULT', 'fcm'),

    'clients' => [
        'fcm' => [
            'driver' => 'fcm_v1',
            'project_id' => env('NOTIFY_FCM_PROJECT_ID'),
            'service_account_json' => storage_path(env('NOTIFY_FCM_SA_PATH')),
            'scopes' => [
                'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/firebase.messaging',
            ],
            'timeout' => 10,
        ],
    ],

    'logging' => [
        'enabled' => env('NOTIFY_LOG', true),
        'channel' => env('NOTIFY_LOG_CHANNEL', null),
    ],
```

## Usage

We have two ways to use Notify in Laravel, with a Facade or via the Notification Channel. Use the one that best fits your needs.

### Via Facade:
This one is the simplest way to use Notify in Laravel, just call the `Notify` facade and send your notification. Recommended for a single notification.

```php 
use Notify;

$result = Notify::send(
    ['token' => 'AAA', 'topic' => null, 'condition' => null],
    ['title' => 'Hola', 'body' => 'Mensaje de prueba', 'data' => ['foo' => 'bar']],
    'fcm'
);

// $result is an instance of Dev1\NotifyCore\DTO\PushResult, use it for response handling.
```

### Via Notification Channel:
This one is intended to being used with Laravel Notifications, so you can use all the features of Laravel Notifications like queues, markdown, etc.

```php
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;

class OrderPaid extends Notification
{
    public function via($notifiable) { return ['dev1-notify']; }

    public function toDev1Notify($notifiable): array
    {
        return [
            'target' => [
                'token' => $notifiable->fcm_token, // DB field
                'topic' => null,
                'condition' => null,
            ],
            'payload' => [
                'title' => 'Payment Received',
                'body' => "Your order has been paid. Enjoy!",
                'data' => ['order_id' => 123], // Optional custom data
            ],
            'client' => 'fcm',
        ];
    }
}
```

## Events

Every push sent through `dev1-notify` channel dispatches:

`Dev1\NotifyLaravel\Events\NotifySent` event, which contains the following properties:
- `$notifiable`: The notifiable entity (e.g., User model).
- `$notification`: The notification instance.
- `$pushResult`: An instance of `Dev1\NotifyCore\DTO\PushResult`, containing details about the push result.

---

## Testing

You can run the tests with:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
### CI & CD

CI is provided with GitHub Actions, it runs on every push and pull request to the `master` branch. It runs the tests and generates code coverage reports.

- Enforces ‚â• 80% coverage
- Coverage badge updated via Gist
